Debugging these types of errors involves a systematic approach:

1. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible and up-to-date version. Use `expo --version` to check.
2. **Examine Package.json:** Scrutinize your dependencies for conflicts. Check for peer dependency issues using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
3. **Review Expo SDK Version:** Make sure your project's Expo SDK version aligns with the Expo CLI and other dependencies.
4. **Simplify Project:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue.  Remove unnecessary packages and code to pinpoint the problem source. 
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try running `expo prebuild` and `expo start --clear` to clear caches and rebuild the project.
6. **Check Expo Logs:** Pay close attention to the full error messages and stack traces provided by the Expo CLI during the build process.   They often hold clues to the underlying problem.
7. **Search for Similar Issues:**  Search online forums, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow for similar error reports.  Someone might have encountered and solved the same problem. 
8. **Examine your configuration files:** check your `app.json` or `expo.json` for any misconfigurations.  Double-check for typos or conflicting settings.
