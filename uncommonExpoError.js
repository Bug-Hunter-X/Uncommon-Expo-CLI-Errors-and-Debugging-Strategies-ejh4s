This error typically occurs when you are using the Expo CLI and attempt to run a project that has dependencies or configurations that are incompatible with the Expo managed workflow or your current Expo CLI version.  It can manifest in various ways, such as build failures, unexpected runtime errors, or even the CLI itself crashing or hanging. The root cause is often subtle and hard to pinpoint, requiring careful examination of your project setup and dependencies.
